<p align="center">
I got this ticket. The employee says she can hear the sound. It must be the cable connection or input source issue.

<br/>

First I had to find the employee's desk. Her desk is in the warehouse.<br/>

I went to the warehouse and found her desk. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
I turned on the system, but the monitor shows 'No signal' message. I'm going to press the monitor menu button on the right bottom corner to set the input source correctly.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
There is a source tab.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<p align="center">
I set the input source to the other one.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
Now it shows the login screen. I can mark it as done.<br/>

I launched the browser, went to the browser history and selected the IP address for the router, which is 192.168.45.1<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
After logging in with the admin credentials, I clicked on the ports tab. There are four. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
I checked the detailed task requirements. I have to open Port 4 and then assign 10.175.35.1 as its IP and /23 as subnet mask to it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
I decided to go to the home page of the browser and then a forum.<br/>

<br/>

<p align="center">
There was a forum thread about calculating the subnet mask. I know the basics of subnetting, but I wanted to check it anyway for demonstration purposes of this simulator.

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
There was some detailed explantion about subnetting at the top of the thread, but I scrolled down and found one user saying that it's not practical to calculate it manually every time at work and suggests to use a website that calculates it for me.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
Once I click on the link, I encounter a webpage that looks like https://jodies.de/ipcalc in real life. All I had to do was just enter the IP address and netmask. It also calculates and shows other things that might be useful.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
I went back to the router configuration admin page and filled out the information to open the port.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
All task objectives have been completed. I can mark it as done.<br/>
